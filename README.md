# Timetable
A web application for displaying your timetable



## Usage
I suggest using it the following way:

- Edit configuration.js to match your schedule and subjects
- Copy all files onto your phone
- Open index.html using your phone's browser
- Add it to your home screen, so you can use it like an app
