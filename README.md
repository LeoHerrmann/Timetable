# Timetable
A simple web application for keeping track of your schedule



## Installation and setup
I recommend proceeding the following way:

- Clone or download the files
- Edit configuration.js to match your schedule and subjects and preferred colors (Sorry, I haven't implemented a more user friendly way yet...)
- Open index.html using a web browser
- Create a shortcut to your home screen or desktop for faster access
