# Timetable
A simple progressive web application that helps you keep track of your school or university schedule

I made this app primarily for personal use, however you can still feel free to try it out yourself. If you happen to do so, I'd really appreciate you to give me some feedback aswell.

## Installation

### Using it as a progressive web application
Since this is a progressive web application, there is no need to install it because the service worker caches all the necessary application files during first use. This allows you to use this application even when you are offline. On mobile, you can add this application to your homescreen to make it feel more like a native app. 

### Local Installation
You can still install the application the "traditional way" by downloading the files or cloning this repository and opening the index.html to start it.
